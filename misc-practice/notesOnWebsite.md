Critiques and notes on http://paulgraham.com/

Website uses outdated button formating. A flat design would go a ways into making it more modern.

Content renders in a small area of the website and would be better served if it were spread out with more whitespace between elements.

All styling seems to be done using HTML instead of CSS. Changing this would allow greater ability to apply styling across the website

External links take you away from the site without opening in a new tab.

Site also does not use any header tags, making screen readers more difficult.
